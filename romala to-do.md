# Support for romanic language from the english keyboard

- why did I create this
-- struggle writing spanish, portuguese and french when using an englsih keyboard
---- video of the experience writing spanish from an english keyboard, memorizing the (n) location in a english layout, copy and pasting letter fro the internet or looking for the right character in the char map

- should this be nested under us keyboard?
